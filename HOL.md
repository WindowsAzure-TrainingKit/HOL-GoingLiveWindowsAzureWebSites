# Going Live with Windows Azure Web Sites #

---
<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##

When you create a web site, Windows Azure provides a friendly subdomain on the azurewebsites.net domain so your users can access your web site using a URL like http://\<mysite\>.azurewebsites.net. However, if you configure your web sites for shared or standard mode, you can map your web site to your own domain name.

Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption is the most commonly used method of securing data sent across the internet, and assures visitors to your site that their transactions with your site are secure. This common task discusses how to enable SSL for a Windows Azure Web Site.

	_Creating a new Web Site_

1. Click **Compute**, **Web Site** and then **Quick Create**. Provide an available URL for the new web site and click **Create Web Site**.

	> **Note:** A Windows Azure Web Site is the host for a web application running in the cloud that you can control and manage. The Quick Create option allows you to deploy a completed web application to the Windows Azure Web Site from outside the portal. It does not include steps for setting up a database.

	![Creating a new Web Site using Quick Create](Images/quick-create.png?raw=true "Creating a new Web Site using Quick Create")

	_Creating a new Web Site using Quick Create_

1. Wait until the new **Web Site** is created.
	
	> **Note:** By default, Windows Azure provides domains at _azurewebsites.net_, but also gives you the possibility to set custom domains using the Windows Azure Management Portal. However, you can only manage custom domains if you are using certain Web Site modes.
	
	> Windows Azure offers 3 modes for users to run their web sites - Free, Shared, and Standard. In Free and Shared mode, all web sites run in a multi-tenant environment and have quotas for CPU, Memory, and Network usage. You can mix and match which sites are Free (strict quotas) vs. Shared (more relaxed quotas). The maximum number of free sites may vary with your plan. The Standard mode applies to ALL of your sites and makes them run on dedicated virtual machines that correspond to the standard Azure compute resources. You can find the Web Sites Mode configuration in the **Scale** menu of your Web Site.

### Exercise 1: Configuring a custom domain name for a Windows Azure web site ###

The steps in this exercise require you to configure your web sites for shared or standard mode. Because the Web Sites feature is in preview and we are adding capacity on a measured basis, you may receive a "_Not enough available reserved instance servers to satisfy this request_" error. If you receive this error, you will need to try again later to perform this task.

You can use a CNAME record to point your domain name to your Windows Azure web site. You can also configure an A record to point the domain name to Windows Azure web site. The process requires that you wait for the CNAME and A records propagate before you can finally set the domain name in the management portal.

There are two ways you can configure the Domain Name Server (DNS) settings on your domain registrar to point to your Windows Azure web site:

1.	**CNAME or Alias record**

	With a CNAME, you map a _specific_ domain, such as www.contoso.com or myblog.contoso.com, to the \<_mysite_\>.azurewebsites.net domain name of your Windows Azure web site.
	Using the Microsoft sample domain, contoso.com, as an example:
	
	o	You can typically map subdomains such as www.contoso.com or MySubSite.contoso.com.

	o	Typically you cannot map naked domains such as contoso.com or wildcard names such as *.contoso.com.

1.	**A record**

	With an A record, you map a domain (e.g., contoso.com or www.contoso.com) or a wildcard domain (e.g., *.contoso.com) to the single public IP address of a deployment within a Windows Azure web site.

	The main benefit of this approach over using CNAMEs is that you can map root domains (e.g., contoso.com) and wildcard domains (e.g., *.contoso.com), in addition to subdomains (e.g., www.contoso.com).

The task includes the following steps:

1. Configuring your web sites for shared mode.
1. Configuring the CNAME on your domain registrar.
1. Configuring an A record on your domain registrar.
1. Setting the domain name in management portal

You can also optionally [Configure an A record for the domain name](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/net/common-tasks/custom-dns-web-site/).

<a name="configure-your-web-sites-for-shared-mode" />
#### Task 1 - Configuring your web sites for shared mode ####

Setting a CNAME record is the recommended way to map your domain name to your Windows Azure web site. Mapping a CNAME record insulates your web site from changes that could affect the underlying IP address of the site.

Setting a custom domain name on a web site is only available for the shared and standard modes for Windows Azure web sites. Before switching a web site from the free web site mode to the shared or standard web site mode, you must first remove spending caps in place for your web site subscription. For more information on shared and standard mode pricing, see [Pricing Details ](https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/details/).

1.	In your browser, open the [Windows Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com/).

1.	In the **Web Sites** tab, click the name of your site.

	![Web Sites Tab](Images/web-sites-tab.png?raw=true "Web Sites Tab")

	_Web Sites Tab_

1.	Click the **Scale** tab.

	![Scale-tab-azure-websites](Images/scale-tab-azure-websites.png?raw=true "Scale-tab-azure-websites")

	_Scale Tab_

1.	In the **general** section, set the web site mode to **Shared**.

	![Shared Website Mode](Images/shared-wesite-mode.png?raw=true "Shared Website Mode")

	_Shared Website Mode_

1.	Click **Save** at the bottom toolbar.

	![Save Button](Images/save-button.png?raw=true "Save Button")

	_Save Button_

1.	On the **You are changing to a mode that may have a billing impact. Continue?** (If you select **STANDARD**, the confirmation message will be: **Are you sure you want to upgrade from Free to STANDARD web site mode?**), click **Yes**.

	>**Note**: If you receive a "Configuring scale for web site '\<site name\>' failed" error you can use the details button to get more information. You may receive a "Not enough available reserved instance servers to satisfy this request" error. The web sites feature is in preview and we are adding capacity on a measured basis. If you receive this error, you will need to try again later to upgrade your account.

<a name="configure-the-cname-on-your-domain-registrar" />
#### Task 2 - Configuring the CNAME on your domain registrar ####

To configure a custom domain name, you must create a CNAME record in your custom domain name's DNS table. Each registrar has a similar but slightly different method of specifying a CNAME record, but the concept is the same. Once you have configured the CNAME record, it will take some time to propagate.

1.	If not already open, browse to the [Windows Azure Management Portal ](http://manage.windowsazure.com/) and take note of your web site name.

1.	Log on to your DNS registrar's web site, and go to the page for managing DNS. You might find this in a section, such as Domain Name, DNS, or Name Server Management.

1.	Now find the section for managing CNAME's. You may have to go to an advanced settings page and look for the words CNAME, Alias, or Subdomains.

1.	Finally, you must provide a subdomain alias, such as www. Then, you must provide a hostname, which is your application's _azurewebsites.net_ domain composed by the name you took note in step one and the azurewebsites.net domain (e.g.: www.[YOUR-SITE-NAME].azurewebsites). To verify authorization, create a CNAME resource record with your DNS provider that points from awverify.www.[YOUR-CUSTOM-DOMAIN].com to awverify.[YOUR-SITE-NAME].azurewebsites.net. Your DNS configuration should be similar to the following:

	|**Alias** |**TTL** |**Type** |**Value** |
	|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
	| awverify.www.[YOUR-CUSTOM-DOMAIN].com | 86400 | CNAME | awverify.[YOUR-SITE-NAME].azurewebsites.net |
	| www.[YOUR-CUSTOM-DOMAIN].com | 86400 | CNAME | [YOUR-SITE-NAME].azurewebsites.net |

	This way, using [YOUR-CUSTOM-DOMAIN].com, the previously configured CNAME records forward all traffic from _www.[YOUR-CUSTOM-DOMAIN].com_ to _[YOUR-SITE-NAME].azurewebsites.net_, which is the DNS name of your deployed application.

	> **Note**: It can take some time for your CNAME to propagate through the DNS system. You cannot set the CNAME for the web site until the CNAME has propagated. 

<a name="task-3---configuring-an-a-record" />
#### Task 3 - Configuring an A record for the domain name####

To configure an A record you must configure a CNAME record used to verify the domain name. This process is the same as the one used to configure a CNAME record to point to your web site, except that you configure the CNAME record domain names that will be used for verification purposes. For example, using [YOUR-CUSTOM-DOMAIN].com, the hostname will be awverify.www.[YOUR-CUSTOM-DOMAIN].com and the value will be awverify.[YOUR-SITE-NAME].azurewebsites.net. Once this is propagated, you can configure the A record.

1.	In your browser, open the [Windows Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com/).

1.	In the **Web Sites** tab, click the name of your site.

1.	Click the **Configure** tab.

	![Configure Tab](Images/configure-tab.png?raw=true "Configure Tab")

	_Configure Tab_

1.	Scroll down until the **domain Names** section and click **manage domains**

	![Domain Names section](Images/domain-names-section.png?raw=true "Domain Names section")

	_Domain Names section_

1.	On the **Manage custom domains** dialog locate **The IP Address to use when configuring A records** and copy the IP address.

	![Manage custom domains dialog box](Images/manage-custom-domains-dialog-box2.png?raw=true "Manage custom domains dialog box")

	_Manage custom domains dialog box_

1.	Log on to your DNS registrar's web site, and go to the page for managing DNS. You might find this in a section, such as Domain Name, DNS, or Name Server Management.

1.	Configure the domain name and the IP address you copied in step 5. Your DNS configuration should be similar to the following:

	| **Alias** | **TTL** | **Type** | **Value** |
	|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
	| awverify.www.[YOUR-CUSTOM-DOMAIN].com | 86400 | CNAME | awverify.[YOUR-SITE-NAME].azurewebsites.net |
	| [YOUR-CUSTOM-DOMAIN].com	 | 7200 | A | [PUBLIC-IP] |

	This way, the previously configured A record forwards all traffic from _[YOUR-CUSTOM-DOMAIN].com_ to _[PUBLIC-IP]_.

<a name="set-the-domain-name-in-management-portal" />
#### Task 4 - Setting the Domain Name in the Management Portal ####

Once the CNAME or A record for domain name has propagated, you must associate it with your web site.

1.	In your browser, open the [Windows Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com/).

1.	In the **Web Sites** tab, click the name of your site.

1.	Click the **Configure** tab.

	![Configure Tab](Images/configure-tab.png?raw=true "Configure Tab")

	_Configure Tab_

1.	Scroll down until the **domain Names** section and click on **manage domains**

	![Domain Names section](Images/domain-names-section.png?raw=true "Domain Names section")

	_Domain Names section_

1.	In the **DOMAIN NAMES** text box type the domain name you have configured. Click the check mark to accept the domain name.

	![Manage custom domains dialog box](Images/manage-custom-domains-dialog-box.png?raw=true "Manage custom domains dialog box")

	_Manage custom domains dialog box_

	Windows Azure validates the existence of the hostname in the public DNS before it save changes and updates the internal Windows Azure DNS. There are few reasons we are validating the hostname before committing the save. One of the primary reasons is that by waiting until the CNAME change propagates, we can verify that the custom domain belongs to the site owner. Verification allows our router to set up the route for each hostname, and ensures that every hostname belongs to one and only one site.

1. Open internet explorer and browse to http://www.[YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME].com

### Exercise 2: Configuring an SSL certificate for a Windows Azure web site ###

The steps in this exercise require you to configure your web sites for standard mode, which may incur additional costs if you are currently using free or shared mode. 

<a name="get-a-certificate" />
#### Task 1 - Getting a Certificate ####

To configure SSL for an application, you first need to get an SSL certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA), a trusted third-party who issues certificates for this purpose. If you do not already have one, you will need to obtain one from a company that sells SSL certificates.

The certificate must meet the following requirements for SSL certificates in Windows Azure:

-	The certificate must contain a private key.
-	The certificate must be created for key exchange, exportable to a Personal Information Exchange (.pfx) file.
-	The certificate's subject name must match the domain used to access the web site.
	-	You cannot obtain an SSL certificate from a certificate authority (CA) for the azurewebsites.net domain. You must acquire a custom domain name to use when accessing your web site.
	-	For information on configuring a custom domain name for a Windows Azure Web Site, see [Configuring a custom domain name for a Windows Azure Web Site]( http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/net/common-tasks/custom-dns-web-site/).
-	The certificate must use a minimum of 2048-bit encryption.

To get an SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority you must generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which is sent to the CA. The CA will then return a certificate that is used to complete the CSR. Two common ways to generate a CSR are by using the IIS Manager or [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/). IIS Manager is only available on Windows, while OpenSSL is available for most platforms.

> **Note**: When following either series of steps, you will be prompted to enter a Common Name. If you will be obtaining a wildcard certificate to use with multiple domains (contoso.com, www.contoso.com, sales.contoso.com,) then this value should be *.domainname (_e.g.: *.contoso.com_). If you obtain a certificate for a single domain name, this value must be the exact value that users will enter in the browser to visit your web site.

For simplicity of the lab, you will use a script located in the asset folder that will create a certificate that will match Windows Azure requirements that is not from a Certified Authority. This is not recommended in production environments.

1. Open the **CreateCert.cmd** file with notepad located in **\Source\Assets\certificates**.

1. In the makecert.exe command, update [YOUR-CUSTOM-DOMAIN] to match the one you registered in exercise 1.

	![CreateCert.cmd file](Images/createcertcmd-file.png?raw=true "CreateCert.cmd file")

	_CreateCert.cmd file_

1. Save the file.

1. Open **Developer Command Prompt**.

1. Browse to **Source/Assets/certificates** and execute the **CreateCert** script in the **Developer Command Prompt**.

1. Add the **Private Key** password in the **Create Private Key Password** window and click **OK**.

	![Create Private Key Password](Images/create-private-key-password.png?raw=true "Create Private Key Password")

	_Create Private Key Password_

1. Add the same password in the **Enter Private Key Password** window and click **OK**.

	![Enter Private Key Password](Images/enter-private-key-password.png?raw=true "Enter Private Key Password")

	_Enter Private Key Password_

1. When the script finishes, you will get a **Succeeded** message and the certificates will be created in the **cert** folder.

	![Developer Command Prompt succeeded](Images/developer-command-prompt-succedded.png?raw=true "Developer Command Prompt succeeded")

<a name="configure-standard-mode" />
#### Task 2 - Configuring standard mode in Windows Azure Web Sites####

Enabling SSL on a web site is only available for the standard mode of Windows Azure web sites. Before switching a web site from the free web site mode to the standard web site mode, you must first remove spending caps in place for your Web Site subscription. For more information on shared and standard mode pricing, see [Pricing Details](https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/details/).

1.	In your browser, open the [Windows Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).

1.	In the **Web Sites** tab, click the name of your web site.

1.	Click the **Scale** tab.

	![Scale-tab-azure-websites](Images/scale-tab-azure-websites.png?raw=true "Scale-tab-azure-websites")

	_Scale Tab_

1.	In the **general** section, set the web site mode to **Standard**.

	_Standard Web Site Mode_

	> **Note:** Before switching a web site from the free web site mode to the shared or standard web site mode, you must first remove spending caps in place for your web site subscription. For more information on shared and standard mode pricing, see [Pricing Details ](https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/details/).

1.	Click **Save** and, when prompted, click **Yes**.

	> **Note**: If you receive a "Configuring scale for web site '<site name>' failed" error you can use the details button to get more information. You may receive a "Not enough available reserved instance servers to satisfy this request." error. If you receive this error, you will need to try again later to upgrade your account.

#### Task 3 - Configuring SSL in Windows Azure Web Sites####

Before performing the steps in this section, you must have associated a custom DNS name with your Windows Azure Web Site.

1.	In your browser, open the [Windows Azure Management Portal ](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).

1.	In the **Web Sites** section, click the name of your site and then select the **Configure** tab.

1.	Using the **Upload a certificate** dialog, select the .pfx certificate file created earlier using the script. Specify the password that was used to secure the .pfx file. Finally, click the **check** to upload the certificate.

	![Upload a certificate](Images/upload-a-certificate.png?raw=true "Upload a certificate")

	_Upload a certificate_

1.	In the **ssl bindings** section of the **Configure** tab, use the dropdowns to select the domain name to secure with SSL, and the certificate to use. You may also select whether to use Server Name Indication (SNI) or IP based SSL.
	-	IP based SSL associates a certificate with a domain name by mapping the dedicated public IP address of the server to the domain name. This requires each domain name (contoso.com, fabricam.com, etc.) associated with your service to have a dedicated IP address. This is the traditional method of associating SSL certificates with a web server.
	-	SNI based SSL is an extension to SSL and Transport Layer Security (TLS) that allows multiple domains to share the same IP address, with separate security certificates for each domain. Most modern browsers (including Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox and Opera) support SNI, however older browsers may not support SNI.
